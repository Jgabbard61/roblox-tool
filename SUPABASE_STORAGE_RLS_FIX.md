# Supabase Storage RLS Policy Fix Guide

## üîç Problem Explanation

You're getting the error: **"Failed to upload file: new row violates row-level security policy"**

### What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?

Row-Level Security (RLS) is a security feature in Supabase that controls who can access and modify data at the row level. When enabled (which it is by default for Supabase Storage), **every operation requires an explicit policy** that grants permission.

### Why Did This Error Occur?

Your `customer-logos` bucket is set to **Public**, which means:
- ‚úÖ Anyone can **read/view** files (SELECT)
- ‚ùå But **no one can upload** files (INSERT) because there's no policy allowing it

Your application code uses the Supabase **anon key** (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to authenticate storage operations. Without RLS policies granting the anon key permission to INSERT, the upload fails.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Solution

We need to create RLS policies that allow:
1. **Authenticated requests** (using your anon key) to **INSERT** (upload) files
2. **Everyone** to **SELECT** (read) files (for public display)
3. **Authenticated requests** to **UPDATE** and **DELETE** files

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"+ New query"**

### Step 2: Run the RLS Policy Creation Script

Copy and paste the **entire SQL script** below into the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Supabase Storage RLS Policies for customer-logos Bucket
-- ============================================================================
-- This script creates policies to allow authenticated users to upload, update,
-- and delete logos, while allowing public read access for displaying logos.
-- ============================================================================

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ POLICY: Allow authenticated users to INSERT (upload) files
-- This allows your application (using the anon key) to upload logo files
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated, anon
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'customer-logos');

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ POLICY: Allow public SELECT (read) access to all files
-- This allows logos to be displayed publicly on your website
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'customer-logos');

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ POLICY: Allow authenticated users to UPDATE files
-- This allows replacing existing logo files
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated, anon
USING (bucket_id = 'customer-logos')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'customer-logos');

-- 4Ô∏è‚É£ POLICY: Allow authenticated users to DELETE files
-- This allows removing old logo files when uploading a new one
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated, anon
USING (bucket_id = 'customer-logos');

-- ============================================================================
-- VERIFICATION: List all policies for the storage.objects table
-- ============================================================================
-- Run this query to verify the policies were created successfully
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
  AND schemaname = 'storage'
  AND policyname LIKE '%logos%'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

### Step 3: Execute the Script

1. Click the **"Run"** button (or press `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`)
2. You should see a success message confirming the policies were created
3. The verification query at the end will show you all the policies that were created

### Step 4: Test the Logo Upload

1. Go back to your application
2. Navigate to the **Super Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Customers** tab
3. Try uploading a customer logo again
4. ‚úÖ The upload should now work successfully!

## üß™ Verification Steps

### Verify Policies Were Created

Run this query in the SQL Editor to check your policies:

```sql
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd as operation,
    roles,
    CASE 
        WHEN qual IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has USING clause'
        ELSE 'No USING clause'
    END as using_check,
    CASE 
        WHEN with_check IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has WITH CHECK clause'
        ELSE 'No WITH CHECK clause'
    END as with_check_status
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
  AND schemaname = 'storage'
  AND policyname LIKE '%logos%'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;
```

Expected output should show **4 policies**:
- 1 for INSERT
- 1 for SELECT  
- 1 for UPDATE
- 1 for DELETE

### Test Upload Functionality

1. **Test Upload**: Upload a logo through your admin dashboard
   - Should succeed with no errors
   - Check the Supabase Storage browser to see the file

2. **Test Display**: View a customer page where the logo is displayed
   - Logo should load correctly
   - Check browser console for no 403 errors

3. **Test Update**: Upload a new logo for the same customer
   - Old logo should be replaced
   - New logo should display

4. **Test Delete**: Delete a customer logo
   - File should be removed from storage
   - No errors should occur

## üîê Security Explanation

### Why These Policies Are Safe

1. **Bucket Isolation**: All policies are scoped to `bucket_id = 'customer-logos'`
   - Policies only affect files in this specific bucket
   - Other buckets remain protected

2. **Public Read is Safe**: The SELECT policy allows public access
   - This is intentional for displaying logos on your website
   - Only affects this bucket, not your entire database

3. **Controlled Write Access**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE require authentication
   - Only requests with valid anon key can modify files
   - Your anon key is secured in environment variables

4. **No File System Access**: Storage is isolated
   - These policies don't grant access to database tables
   - They only control access to files in Supabase Storage

### Additional Security Considerations

Your application code already includes:

‚úÖ **File Type Validation**: Only allows image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp)
‚úÖ **File Size Limits**: Maximum 5MB per file
‚úÖ **Authentication Check**: Only SUPER_ADMIN role can upload
‚úÖ **File Naming Convention**: Files are named `customer-{id}.{ext}`

These application-level validations work **in addition to** the RLS policies.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Policies Already Exist

**Error**: `ERROR: policy "Allow authenticated users to upload logos" already exists`

**Solution**: Policies were already created. You can either:

1. **Skip this step** - Policies are already in place
2. **Delete and recreate** - Run this first:

```sql
-- Delete existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to upload logos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to logos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to update logos" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to delete logos" ON storage.objects;
```

Then run the creation script again.

### Issue: Upload Still Fails

**Error**: Still getting RLS errors after creating policies

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Environment Variables Not Set**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set
   
   ```bash
   # Check your .env.local file
   cat .env.local | grep SUPABASE
   ```

2. **Bucket Name Mismatch**: Verify the bucket name is exactly `customer-logos`
   
   ```sql
   -- Check bucket name in Supabase
   SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets;
   ```

3. **Anon Key Invalid**: The anon key might be incorrect
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy the `anon` `public` key
   - Update your `.env.local` file

### Issue: Logos Don't Display

**Symptom**: Upload succeeds but logos don't show on the website

**Solution**: Check bucket is public

```sql
-- Make sure bucket is public
UPDATE storage.buckets 
SET public = true 
WHERE name = 'customer-logos';
```

### Issue: 403 Forbidden When Viewing Logos

**Symptom**: Logos uploaded but can't be viewed (403 error in browser console)

**Solution**: Ensure SELECT policy exists

```sql
-- Verify SELECT policy
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
  AND schemaname = 'storage'
  AND cmd = 'SELECT'
  AND policyname LIKE '%logos%';
```

If no results, create the SELECT policy again:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to logos"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'customer-logos');
```

## üí° What You Learned

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)** controls data access at the row level in Supabase
2. **Public buckets** only allow READ access by default - write operations need explicit policies
3. **Storage objects** are stored in the `storage.objects` table with RLS enabled
4. **Policies** must be created for each operation type: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
5. **Authentication roles** include `authenticated`, `anon`, and `public`
6. Your app uses the **anon key** for storage operations, which needs explicit permission

---

## üéâ You're Done!

Your Supabase Storage is now properly configured with RLS policies. Logo uploads should work seamlessly. If you encounter any issues, refer to the Troubleshooting section above.
