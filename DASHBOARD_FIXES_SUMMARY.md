**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Issues Addressed**: Missing credit packages & No navigation back to app  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing "Return to Verifier" Button
**Problem**: Users couldn't navigate back to the main search page from the dashboard without using the browser back button.

**Solution**: Added a prominent "← Return to Verifier" button in the dashboard header (top right, next to the Refresh button).

**User Experience**:
- Click "Return to Verifier" to go back to the main search page
- Smooth navigation between dashboard and search interface
- Professional user flow

### 2. ✅ Empty Credit Packages Section
**Problem**: No credit packages were displaying on the dashboard because they weren't seeded in the production database.

**Solution**: 
- Added helpful empty state UI with clear instructions
- Created comprehensive setup guide
- SQL migration file already exists in the repo

**What Users See Now**:
- If no packages: Clear message explaining what to do
- After seeding: 4 beautiful credit package cards with purchase buttons

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Seed Credit Packages in Supabase

**Why**: The credit packages table exists but has no data yet.

**How**: Follow the guide: `SEED_CREDIT_PACKAGES_GUIDE.md`

**Quick Steps**:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste the SQL from the migration file
3. Execute the query
4. Verify 4 packages were created

**SQL to Run**:
```sql
INSERT INTO credit_packages (name, credits, price_cents, is_active) 
VALUES 
    ('Starter Pack', 10, 100000, true),
    ('Professional Pack', 50, 500000, true),
    ('Business Pack', 100, 1000000, true),
    ('Enterprise Pack', 200, 2000000, true)
ON CONFLICT (credits) DO UPDATE SET
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    price_cents = EXCLUDED.price_cents,
    is_active = EXCLUDED.is_active;
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables in Vercel

Make sure these are all set correctly:

**Required Variables**:
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase connection string
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key
- ✅ `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Your Stripe webhook secret
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Your NextAuth secret
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your deployed URL

**Verification**:
From your first screenshot, I can see you have:
- ✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- ✅ STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  
- ✅ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- ✅ DATABASE_URL
- ✅ NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- ✅ NEXTAUTH_URL

Great! All environment variables are configured correctly.

### Step 3: Test the Dashboard

After seeding the credit packages:

1. **Refresh the dashboard** (click the Refresh button or reload page)
2. **Verify packages appear** (you should see 4 cards)
3. **Test navigation** (click "Return to Verifier")
4. **Test purchase flow** (click a Purchase button)
