# 🚨 QUICK FIX: Bucket Not Found Error

## 30-Second Fix

### 1️⃣ Go to Supabase Storage
https://supabase.com/dashboard → **Storage**

### 2️⃣ Create Bucket
Click **"New bucket"** → Name: `customer-logos` → ✅ **Public bucket** → **Create**

### 3️⃣ Test
Upload a logo in your app → Should work! ✅

## Details

**Bucket Name:** `customer-logos` (exactly this!)  
**Settings:** Must be PUBLIC  
**Location:** Same Supabase project as your DATABASE_URL  

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check if bucket was created successfully
# You should see it in: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/storage/buckets
```

In your Storage dashboard, you should see:
```
📦 customer-logos (Public) ← This should exist!
```

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check project**: Make sure you're in the same Supabase project (check DATABASE_URL)
2. **Check public**: Bucket must have "Public" badge
3. **Check name**: Must be exactly `customer-logos` (no typos!)
4. **Add policies**: Run the SQL from `FIX_BUCKET_NOT_FOUND.md` Step 5
