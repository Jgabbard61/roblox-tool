- `initializeCustomerCredits(customerId)` - Initialize credit account for new customers
- `deductCredits(params)` - Deduct credits with transaction logging
- `addCredits(params)` - Add credits after purchase with transaction logging
- `getTransactionHistory(customerId, limit, offset)` - Get paginated transaction history
- `getCreditPackages()` - Get all active credit packages
- `getCreditPackageById(packageId)` - Get specific package
- `logStripePayment(params)` - Log Stripe payment to database
- `needsLowBalanceAlert(customerId, threshold)` - Check if low balance alert needed
- `getCreditSummary(customerId)` - Get comprehensive credit summary for dashboard

**Key Features:**
- Atomic transactions using PostgreSQL's transaction system
- Proper locking with `FOR UPDATE` to prevent race conditions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Transaction history with balance tracking (balance_before, balance_after)

      "name": "Starter Package",
      "credits": 10,
      "price": 1000,
      "price_per_credit": 100,
      "is_active": true,
      "description": "Perfect for getting started"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Authentication:** Required (JWT)  
**Query Params:** `limit`, `offset`  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "transactions": [...],
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "count": 10
}
```

#### POST /api/credits/checkout

3. Initialize customer credit account if needed
4. Add credits to account (atomic transaction)
5. Log Stripe payment
6. Send welcome email (if first purchase) with temp password
7. Send purchase confirmation email (if returning customer)
8. Return success response

---

### 3. Email Service
**Location:** `src/app/lib/email/index.ts`

**Provider:** Resend (https://resend.com)

**Email Types:**

#### Welcome Email
**Sent:** After first purchase  
**Contains:**
- Temporary password
- Login credentials
- Credit balance
- Getting started guide
- Security reminder

#### Purchase Confirmation Email
**Sent:** After successful purchase

---

### 4. Search Integration - Credit Checking & Deduction

**Modified Files:**
- `src/app/api/search/route.tsx` - Smart/Display Name search
- `src/app/api/roblox/route.tsx` - Exact search (POST for username, GET for user ID)

**Credit Logic:**

#### Before Search Execution:
```typescript
// Check if customer has ≥1 credit
const hasSufficientCredits = await checkSufficientCredits(customerId, 1);

if (!hasSufficientCredits) {
  return 402 Payment Required with current balance
}
```

#### After Search Execution:

**Exact Search:**
- Results found: Deduct 1 credit ✅
- NO results found: FREE (0 credits) ✅

**Smart Search:**
- Always deduct 1 credit ✅

**Display Name Search:**
- Always deduct 1 credit ✅

**Implementation:**
```typescript
let shouldDeductCredits = false;

if (searchMode === 'smart' || searchMode === 'displayName') {
  shouldDeductCredits = true; // Always deduct
} else {
  // Exact search: Only if results found
  if (users.length > 0) {
    shouldDeductCredits = true;
  }
}

if (shouldDeductCredits) {
  await deductCredits({
    customerId,
    userId,
    amount: 1,
    searchHistoryId,
    description: `${searchMode} search for "${keyword}"`,
  });
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Non-blocking (async credit deduction)
- Links transaction to search_history record
- Comprehensive error logging
- Doesn't fail search if credit deduction fails (but logs error)

---

### 5. Database Schema Updates

**Note:** Database tables were already migrated in Supabase (as per project context). The implementation uses the following tables:

- ✅ `customers` - Added `stripe_customer_id` column
- ✅ `customer_credits` - Tracks credit balances
- ✅ `credit_transactions` - Logs all credit transactions
- ✅ `credit_packages` - Stores available packages
- ✅ `stripe_payments` - Logs Stripe payments
- ✅ `search_history` - Already has `search_mode` column

---

### 6. Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "stripe": "Latest version",
  "resend": "Latest version",
  "@stripe/stripe-js": "Latest version"
}
```

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install stripe resend @stripe/stripe-js
```

---

### 7. Environment Variables

**Updated:** `.env.example`

**New Variables:**
```bash
# Application
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - `APP_URL` (production URL)
3. Restart deployment

### 2. Stripe Webhook Setup

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"

5. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Resend Email Setup

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Create account and verify domain (e.g., verifylens.com)
3. Generate API key
4. Add to `RESEND_API_KEY`
5. Update `FROM_EMAIL` in `src/app/lib/email/index.ts` to your verified domain

### 4. Database Migration

**Note:** According to project context, all tables are already migrated in Supabase.

**Verify tables exist:**
```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM customer_credits LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM credit_transactions LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM credit_packages;
SELECT * FROM stripe_payments LIMIT 1;
```

**Verify credit packages inserted:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM credit_packages WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Expected packages:**
- Starter: 10 credits / $1,000 ($100 per credit)
- Professional: 50 credits / $5,000
- Business: 100 credits / $10,000
- Enterprise: 200 credits / $20,000

### 5. Test the Flow

**Manual Test:**
1. Register/login to app
2. Navigate to dashboard (to be created)
3. Click "Buy Credits"
4. Select a package
5. Complete Stripe checkout (use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
6. Verify credits added to account
7. Verify email received
8. Perform a search
9. Verify credit deducted
10. Check transaction history

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### ✅ Implemented

- **Atomic Transactions:** All credit operations use database transactions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript types for all functions
- **Security:** JWT authentication, Stripe signature verification
- **Non-Blocking:** Async operations don't block user requests
- **Logging:** Detailed console logging for debugging
- **Documentation:** Inline comments explaining logic

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (Phase 2)

- Add unit tests for credit service functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Add monitoring/alerting for failed credit deductions
- Add retry logic for email sending
- Add database connection pooling optimization
- Add caching for credit packages
- Add rate limiting for checkout endpoint

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Email Sending Failures
**Issue:** If Resend API fails, email won't be sent but payment will succeed  
**Impact:** Low (credits still added, user can contact support)  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive error logging  
**Future:** Add email queue with retry mechanism

### 2. Credit Deduction Race Conditions
**Issue:** High concurrency could cause race conditions  
**Impact:** Low (PostgreSQL row locking prevents this)  
**Mitigation:** `FOR UPDATE` locking in transactions  
**Future:** Add distributed locks for extreme concurrency

### 3. Webhook Replay Attacks
**Issue:** Webhooks could be replayed if signature compromised  
**Impact:** Low (Stripe signature provides strong protection)  
**Mitigation:** Stripe signature verification  
**Future:** Add idempotency keys

### 4. Search Logging Failure
**Issue:** If logSearch fails, credit deduction might not link to search_history  
**Impact:** Low (transaction still logs with description)  
**Mitigation:** Async logging with error handling  
**Future:** Add retry mechanism
