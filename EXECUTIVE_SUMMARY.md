# VerifyLens Integration - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Quick reference guide for automated credit/billing system integration

---

## Current Situation

### What Works ✅
- **Live App:** verifylens.com with robust search functionality
- **Authentication:** Secure NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
- **Search Types:** Both Exact and Smart search working perfectly
- **Admin Dashboard:** Full CRUD for customers and users
- **Database:** Well-structured PostgreSQL on Supabase
- **Search Logging:** Complete audit trail of all searches

### Critical Gaps ❌
- **No Credit System:** Searches are free and unlimited
- **No Payment Integration:** No Stripe or billing system
- **Manual Account Creation:** Admin must manually create accounts after purchase
- **No Self-Service:** Customers can't sign up or purchase on their own
- **No Usage Enforcement:** Can't limit searches based on credits purchased

---

## The Problem

**Current Manual Workflow:**
```
Customer Contacts Sales → Quote → Payment (outside system) → 
Admin Notified → Admin Creates Account Manually → 
Send Credentials to Customer → Customer Logs In
```

**Time:** 10-30 minutes per customer  
**Scalability:** Poor  
**Error Rate:** High (manual credential handling)  
**Customer Experience:** Slow and cumbersome

---

## The Solution

**Automated Workflow:**
```
Customer Visits Landing Page → Selects Credit Package → 
Stripe Checkout → Payment Success → Webhook Triggers → 
Account Auto-Created → Credits Allocated → 
Welcome Email Sent → Customer Logs In Immediately
```

**Time:** < 1 minute (fully automated)  
**Scalability:** Unlimited  
**Error Rate:** Minimal  
**Customer Experience:** Fast and seamless

---

## Key Requirements

### 1. Database Changes
**New Tables:**
- `credit_packages` - Define credit tiers (10, 50, 100 credits)
- `customer_credits` - Track balance per customer
- `credit_transactions` - Log all credit changes (purchases, usage)
- `stripe_payments` - Store payment records

**New Columns:**
- `customers.stripe_customer_id` - Link to Stripe

### 2. Stripe Integration
- Stripe Checkout Sessions for payment
- Webhook handler for `checkout.session.completed`
- Automatic account creation on successful payment
- Credit allocation linked to payment

### 3. Credit Deduction Logic
- Check balance before search
- Deduct 1 credit per successful search
- **Special Rule:** Exact search with no results = FREE
- Show "Out of Credits" modal when balance = 0
- Low credit warning when balance < 5

### 4. Frontend Updates
- Display credit balance in header
- "Buy More Credits" button → landing page
- Credit transaction history page
- Insufficient credits modal
- Low credit warning banner

### 5. Email Service
- Account creation with credentials
- Payment receipts
- Low credit alerts
- Payment confirmations

---

## Pricing Model

**Recommended:**
- **1 Credit = $100 per search** (both Exact and Smart)
- **Package Tiers:**
  - 10 credits = $1,000
  - 50 credits = $5,000 (save 5%)
  - 100 credits = $10,000 (save 10%)

**Special Rules:**
- Exact search with no results = FREE (don't charge)
- Smart search always charged (returns multiple matches)
