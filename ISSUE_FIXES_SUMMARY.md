## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: No Feedback for Exact Search with No Results ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- When an exact username search didn't find a match, there was no popup or notification to inform the user
- Users were left without guidance on what to do next

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created a new `NoResultsModal` component with a beautiful, user-friendly design
- Modal appears automatically when Exact Search finds no results
- Provides clear messaging: "No Exact Match Found"
- Suggests trying Smart Search as an alternative
- Includes two action buttons:
  - "Close" - dismisses the modal
  - "Try Smart Search" - automatically switches to Smart Search mode and keeps the query

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/components/NoResultsModal.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (updated to integrate modal)
- `src/app/globals.css` (added modal animation)

**Key Features:**
- ‚ú® Beautiful gradient design matching the app's aesthetic
- üéØ Clear call-to-action buttons
- üîÑ Seamless mode switching
- ‚ö° Smooth fade-in animation
- üì± Responsive design

### Issue 2: Display Name Search API Errors and Fuzzy Search Implementation ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Display Name search was encountering 500 API errors
- Error messages were not user-friendly
- It wasn't clear that Display Name search is a fuzzy search

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added try-catch blocks around Display Name search API calls
   - Specific error handling for:
     - Rate limiting (429) - "Rate limited. Please wait before searching again."
     - Service unavailable (503) - "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment."
     - Other errors - Graceful fallback messages
   - Error messages now suggest using Exact Match mode as an alternative

2. **Improved Smart Search Error Handling:**
   - Applied the same enhanced error handling to Smart Search mode for consistency
   - Better error messages for all failure scenarios

3. **Updated UI Messaging:**
   - Updated SearchModeSelector tooltip to clarify: "Fuzzy search by display name (not username). Shows all matching results. 30s cooldown."
   - Better status messages in search results
   - Clear indication that both Smart Search and Display Name use fuzzy matching

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` (enhanced error handling for both Smart and Display Name search)
- `src/app/components/SearchModeSelector.tsx` (updated tooltip)

**Key Features:**
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust error handling
- üìä Specific error messages for different failure types
- üéØ Helpful suggestions when errors occur
- üîÑ Graceful degradation
- üìù Clear documentation of fuzzy search behavior
