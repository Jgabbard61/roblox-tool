     if (mode === 'exact') return 1;      // FREE if no results
     if (mode === 'smart') return 2;       // Always charged
     if (mode === 'displayName') return 1; // Always charged
     return 1;
   };
   ```

4. **Credit Check Before Search**

     if (session?.user?.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') return true;
     return creditBalance >= requiredCredits;
   };
   ```

5. **Pre-Search Validation**

## üîß Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Used

All API endpoints were **already implemented** in Phase 1:

1. **GET** `/api/credits/balance`
   - Returns current credit balance
   - Used by: CreditHeader, Dashboard

2. **GET** `/api/credits/transactions`
   - Returns transaction history
   - Supports pagination (limit, offset)
   - Used by: Dashboard

3. **GET** `/api/credits/packages`
   - Returns all active credit packages
   - Public endpoint (no auth required)
   - Used by: Dashboard

4. **POST** `/api/credits/checkout`
   - Creates Stripe Checkout session
   - Requires authentication
   - Params: `{ packageId: number }`
   - Returns: `{ sessionId, checkoutUrl }`
   - Used by: Dashboard purchase flow

5. **POST** `/api/credits/webhook`
   - Stripe webhook handler
   - Processes `checkout.session.completed` events
   - Adds credits to customer account
   - Logs payment in `stripe_payments` table

---

## üìä Database Tables Used

All database tables were **already created** in Phase 1 migrations:

1. **credit_packages**
   - Stores available packages
   - Fields: id, name, credits, price_cents, is_active

2. **customer_credits**
   - Tracks credit balances
   - Fields: customer_id, balance, total_purchased, total_used

3. **credit_transactions**
   - Immutable audit log
   - Fields: customer_id, user_id, transaction_type, amount, balance_before, balance_after

4. **stripe_payments**
   - Payment records
   - Fields: stripe_payment_intent_id, amount_cents, credits_purchased, status

---

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Design Principles

1. **Consistency**
   - Follows existing Tailwind design system
   - Matches color scheme (blue primary, purple accents)
   - Uses Lucide icons throughout

2. **Accessibility**
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Color contrast meets WCAG standards
   - Loading states for async actions

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Mobile-first grid layouts
   - Responsive card grids (1 col mobile, 4 col desktop)
   - Touch-friendly button sizes

4. **User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for all actions
   - Loading spinners during async operations
   - Color-coded transaction types
   - Visual indicators for low balance

---

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - All routes protected by NextAuth middleware
   - API endpoints check authentication headers
   - Customer ID validated on all requests

2. **Authorization**
   - Super admins bypass credit checks
   - Customers can only access their own data
   - Credit operations require customer_id match

3. **Payment Security**
   - Stripe handles all payment data
   - No credit card data stored locally
   - PCI compliance via Stripe
   - Webhook signature verification
