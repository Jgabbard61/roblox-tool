# Remember Me Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Successfully

A "Remember Me" feature has been successfully implemented for the Roblox Verifier Tool login page.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **User Interface**
- ✅ Added a styled "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page
- ✅ Positioned between the password field and error message section
- ✅ Consistent styling with the existing design (blue accent, proper spacing)
- ✅ Label: "Remember me for 30 days"

### 2. **Authentication Logic**
- ✅ Modified signin form to capture remember me preference
- ✅ Stored preference in localStorage for session management
- ✅ Passed rememberMe parameter to NextAuth signIn function

### 3. **Session Management**
- ✅ Dynamic session duration based on checkbox:
  - **When CHECKED**: Session persists for 30 days
  - **When UNCHECKED**: Session expires after 2 hours
- ✅ JWT token expiration set dynamically in auth configuration
- ✅ Secure cookie configuration with httpOnly and SameSite protection

### 4. **Type Safety**
- ✅ Updated TypeScript definitions for NextAuth
- ✅ Added `rememberMe` property to User and JWT interfaces
- ✅ Added `exp` property to JWT interface for expiration tracking

### 5. **Documentation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation documentation (REMEMBER_ME_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- ✅ Added inline code comments explaining the logic
- ✅ Documented security considerations

## 🔒 Security Features

All security best practices have been maintained:

1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevents XSS attacks
2. **Secure Flag**: Enabled in production for HTTPS
3. **SameSite: Lax**: Protection against CSRF attacks
4. **Encrypted Tokens**: All session tokens encrypted with NEXTAUTH_SECRET
5. **Database Authentication**: Continues to use secure bcrypt password hashing
