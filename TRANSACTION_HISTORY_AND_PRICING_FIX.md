# Transaction History and Pricing Display Fix

**Date:** October 31, 2024  
**Issues Fixed:**
1. Exact searches with "No Results" not showing in transaction history
2. Pricing display missing thousand separators

## Issue 1: Missing Transaction History for Free Searches

### Problem
Exact searches that returned "No Results" were supposed to be logged as free (0 credits) transactions, but they were not appearing in the transaction history.

### Root Cause
The database had a constraint that prevented zero-amount transactions:

```sql
CONSTRAINT credit_transactions_amount_non_zero CHECK (amount != 0)
```

This constraint was blocking the `recordFreeSearch()` function from inserting transactions with `amount = 0` for:
- Exact searches with no results
- Duplicate/cached searches (already fixed earlier)

### Solution

#### Part 1: Database Migration
Created migration `012_allow_zero_credit_transactions.sql`:

```sql
-- Drop the existing non-zero constraint
ALTER TABLE credit_transactions 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS credit_transactions_amount_non_zero;

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_credit_transactions_zero_amount 
ON credit_transactions(customer_id, amount) 
WHERE amount = 0;
```

#### Part 2: Admin API Endpoint
Created `/api/admin/migrate` endpoint that:
- Requires SUPER_ADMIN authentication
- Runs the migration safely
- Returns success/error status

**To run the migration:**
```bash
# As SUPER_ADMIN user, make a POST request:
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/migrate \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

Or access via browser console while logged in as SUPER_ADMIN:
```javascript
fetch('/api/admin/migrate', { method: 'POST' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

## Issue 2: Pricing Display Missing Commas

### Problem
Credit package prices were displayed without thousand separators:
- ‚ùå $1000.00
- ‚ùå $5000.00
- ‚ùå $10000.00
- ‚ùå $20000.00

### Solution
Updated the `formatPrice()` function in `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:

**Before:**
```javascript
const formatPrice = (priceCents: number) => {
  return (priceCents / 100).toFixed(2);
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const formatPrice = (priceCents: number) => {
  const dollars = priceCents / 100;
  return dollars.toLocaleString('en-US', {
    minimumFractionDigits: 2,
    maximumFractionDigits: 2,
  });
};
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ $1,000.00
- ‚úÖ $5,000.00
- ‚úÖ $10,000.00
- ‚úÖ $20,000.00

## Additional Fix: Transaction Type Display

### Problem
Transaction types in the database are stored in uppercase (`PURCHASE`, `USAGE`), but the dashboard was comparing them in lowercase, causing incorrect styling.

### Solution
Updated transaction type comparisons to be case-insensitive:

**Before:**
```javascript
transaction.transaction_type === 'purchase'
```

**After:**
```javascript
transaction.transaction_type.toUpperCase() === 'PURCHASE'
```

This ensures correct color coding:
- üü¢ PURCHASE ‚Üí Green badge
- üîµ USAGE ‚Üí Blue badge
- ‚ö™ Others ‚Üí Gray badge

## Files Changed

1. **Database Migration**
   - `database/migrations/012_allow_zero_credit_transactions.sql` (NEW)
   - `scripts/run-migration-012.js` (NEW)

2. **API Endpoint**
   - `src/app/api/admin/migrate/route.ts` (NEW)

3. **Dashboard**
   - `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
     - Updated `formatPrice()` function (line 212-218)
     - Fixed transaction type comparisons (lines 303, 405, 407)

## Testing Checklist

### After Running Migration:

1. **Test Free Exact Searches (No Results)**
   - Log in as regular user
   - Perform exact search that returns no results
   - Check transaction history ‚Üí Should show entry with 0 credits
   - Check credit balance ‚Üí Should not decrease

2. **Test Duplicate Cached Searches**
   - Perform same search twice after cooldown
   - Check transaction history ‚Üí Should show 0-credit entry for duplicate
   - Check credit balance ‚Üí Should not decrease on second search

3. **Test Pricing Display**
   - Go to "Buy More Credits" section
   - Verify all prices show with commas:
     - $1,000.00 ‚úì
     - $5,000.00 ‚úì
     - $10,000.00 ‚úì
     - $20,000.00 ‚úì

4. **Test Transaction Type Display**
   - View transaction history
   - Verify PURCHASE transactions have green badge
   - Verify USAGE transactions have blue badge
   - Verify 0-credit transactions display correctly

## Migration Instructions

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Run the migration** (SUPER_ADMIN only):
   ```javascript
   // In browser console while logged in as SUPER_ADMIN:
   fetch('/api/admin/migrate', { method: 'POST' })
     .then(r => r.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data));
   ```

2. **Verify migration success:**
   - Response should be: `{ success: true, message: "Migration completed..." }`

3. **Test free searches:**
   - Perform exact search with no results
   - Check if it appears in transaction history

### Alternative: Direct Database Access

If you have direct database access:

```sql
-- Run this SQL directly:
ALTER TABLE credit_transactions 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS credit_transactions_amount_non_zero;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_credit_transactions_zero_amount 
ON credit_transactions(customer_id, amount) 
WHERE amount = 0;
```

## Impact Summary

### Before:
- ‚ùå Exact searches with no results: Not visible in transaction history
- ‚ùå Duplicate cached searches: Not visible in transaction history  
- ‚ùå Pricing: $10000.00 (hard to read)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction badges: Potential styling issues

### After:
- ‚úÖ All searches logged in transaction history (including free ones)
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail of all search activity
- ‚úÖ Pricing: $10,000.00 (easy to read)
- ‚úÖ Correct color coding for all transaction types
- ‚úÖ Better UX and transparency for customers

## Build Status
‚úÖ **Build Successful** - Ready for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Run the database migration as SUPER_ADMIN
3. Test all scenarios listed in the testing checklist
4. Monitor transaction history for free searches
