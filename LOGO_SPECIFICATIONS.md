# Customer Logo Upload Specifications

## üìè Optimal Image Resolution

### Recommended Dimensions
- **Height:** 192 pixels
- **Width:** 400-600 pixels (depending on your logo's aspect ratio)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 2:1 to 4:1 (landscape format)

### Why These Dimensions?

1. **Display Size:** Your logo is displayed at 64px height on the main search page
2. **Retina/High-DPI Support:** 192px provides 3√ó resolution for crisp display on high-DPI screens
3. **Admin Preview:** The admin panel preview shows logos at 192px height, so your logo will look exactly as intended
4. **Quality:** This resolution ensures sharp, professional appearance across all devices

## üé® Format Recommendations

### Best Options (in order of preference):

1. **PNG (Recommended for most logos)**
   - Use for logos with transparency
   - Use for logos with solid colors and gradients
   - Supports transparency (important for logos without backgrounds)
   - File size: Typically 50-500KB with optimization

2. **SVG (Best for simple logos)**
   - Perfect for simple, vector-based logos
   - Infinitely scalable without quality loss
   - Smallest file size
   - Not supported by current upload system - convert to PNG first

3. **JPG/JPEG (Only for photo-based logos)**
   - Use only if your logo is a photograph or has complex imagery
   - Cannot have transparent background
   - Slightly smaller file size than PNG

| Aspect Ratio | Width (px) | Height (px) | Best For |
|--------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| 2:1          | 384        | 192         | Standard company logos |
| 3:1          | 576        | 192         | Wide horizontal logos |
| 4:1          | 768        | 192         | Very wide banner-style logos |
