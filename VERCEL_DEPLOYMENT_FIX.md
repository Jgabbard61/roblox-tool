# Vercel Deployment Fix - Missing Dependencies

## Issue Summary
The Vercel deployment was failing with the following errors:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-hot-toast'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'resend'
```

## Root Cause
The Phase 2 implementation added code that uses `react-hot-toast` (for toast notifications) and `resend` (for email functionality), but these packages were not included in the `package.json` dependencies.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Missing Dependencies
Added the following packages to `package.json`:
- `react-hot-toast@^2.6.0` - For toast notifications in the UI
- `resend@^6.3.0` - For sending transactional emails

### 2. Committed Changes
```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: Add missing dependencies (react-hot-toast, resend)"
git push origin main
```

## Database Migration Issue

### Error
```
ERROR: 42703: column "stripe_payment_intent_id" does not exist
```

### Cause
There are two different credit system migration files in the repository:
1. `database/migrations/004_add_credit_system.sql`
2. `database/migrations/004_create_credit_system_tables.sql`

You may have run the wrong migration file or the migrations are out of sync.

### Solution: Use the Correct Migration

**Run this migration file:** `database/migrations/004_create_credit_system_tables.sql`

This migration includes:
- ✅ `credit_packages` table
- ✅ `customer_credits` table  
- ✅ `credit_transactions` table with `stripe_payment_intent_id` reference
- ✅ `stripe_payments` table with `stripe_payment_intent_id` column
- ✅ All necessary indexes and constraints

### How to Apply the Migration

#### Option 1: In Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `database/migrations/004_create_credit_system_tables.sql`
4. Paste and execute the SQL
5. You should see a success message: "✓ Migration 004 completed successfully"

#### Option 2: Using the Supabase CLI
```bash
# If you have the Supabase CLI installed
supabase migration up
```

#### Option 3: Drop and Recreate (⚠️ Use with caution - data loss)
If the tables already exist with the wrong schema, you may need to drop them first:

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all existing credit data!
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS credit_transactions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_payments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS credit_pricing CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_credits CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS credit_packages CASCADE;

-- Then run the full migration from 004_create_credit_system_tables.sql
```

### Migration Order
If you're setting up from scratch, run migrations in this order:
1. `001_allow_null_customer_id_in_search_history.sql`
2. `002_add_search_mode_column.sql` OR `002_add_email_verification.sql`
3. `003_add_customer_logo.sql`
4. `004_create_credit_system_tables.sql` ⭐ **Use this one**
5. `005_add_stripe_customer_id_to_customers.sql`
6. `006_create_credit_indexes.sql`
7. `007_seed_credit_packages.sql`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Deployment
After the push, Vercel should automatically redeploy. Check:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No module resolution errors
- ✅ Deployment is live

### 2. Check Database Schema
Run this query in your Supabase SQL Editor to verify the credit system tables:

```sql
-- Check if all credit system tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('credit_packages', 'customer_credits', 'credit_transactions', 'stripe_payments')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify stripe_payment_intent_id column exists in credit_transactions
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'credit_transactions' 
AND column_name = 'stripe_payment_intent_id';

-- Verify stripe_payment_intent_id column exists in stripe_payments
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'stripe_payments' 
AND column_name = 'stripe_payment_intent_id';
```

### 3. Test Credit Packages Display
Once deployed:
1. Log in to the customer dashboard
2. Navigate to the credits section
3. You should see the credit packages:
   - Starter Pack (10 credits - $10)
   - Professional Pack (50 credits - $50)
   - Business Pack (100 credits - $100)
   - Enterprise Pack (200 credits - $200)

## Status

✅ **Fixed:** Missing npm dependencies (`react-hot-toast`, `resend`)
✅ **Committed:** Changes pushed to GitHub (commit: 80c3901)
⏳ **Pending:** Database migration needs to be run in Supabase

Once you run the correct database migration (`004_create_credit_system_tables.sql`), the credit system should be fully operational!
