# ✅ Credit System 500 Error Fix - RESOLVED

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The customer dashboard was not displaying credit packages, and browser console showed multiple 500 errors:

```
❌ Failed to load: api/credit-packages:1 (500)
❌ Failed to load: api/credits/balance:1 (500)
❌ Failed to load: api/credits/transactions?limit=10:1 (500)
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

The API routes were querying **columns that didn't exist** in the database tables, causing SQL errors and 500 responses.

### Issue 1: `/api/credit-packages/route.ts`
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Querying non-existent column
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  credits, 
  price_cents, 
  description,    // ❌ This column doesn't exist!
  created_at
FROM credit_packages
```

**Problem:** The `credit_packages` table doesn't have a `description` column.

### Issue 2: `/api/credits/transactions/route.ts`
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Querying non-existent columns and JOINs
SELECT 
  ct.id,
  ct.transaction_type,
  ct.amount,
  ct.balance_after,
  ct.description,
  ct.created_at,
  cp.name as package_name,           // ❌ JOIN to non-existent FK
  ct.payment_amount_cents,            // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  ct.credit_package_id,               // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  u.username as user_username
FROM credit_transactions ct
LEFT JOIN credit_packages cp ON ct.credit_package_id = cp.id  // ❌ FK doesn't exist
LEFT JOIN users u ON ct.user_id = u.id
```

**Problems:**
- `credit_transactions` table doesn't have `credit_package_id` column
- `credit_transactions` table doesn't have `payment_amount_cents` column
- Can't JOIN to `credit_packages` without a foreign key

### Issue 3: `/api/credits/balance/route.ts`
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Multi-statement query in single call
const result = await query(
  `INSERT INTO customer_credits (customer_id, balance, total_purchased, total_used)
   VALUES ($1, 0, 0, 0)
   ON CONFLICT (customer_id) DO NOTHING
   RETURNING balance, total_purchased, total_used;
   
   SELECT balance, total_purchased, total_used, created_at, updated_at
   FROM customer_credits
   WHERE customer_id = $1`,
  [customerId]
);
```

**Problem:** Combining INSERT and SELECT in a single query call can cause issues with result handling.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Remove `description` column from credit-packages query
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Only query existing columns
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  credits, 
  price_cents,     // ✅ Removed description
  created_at
FROM credit_packages
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY credits ASC
```

### Fix 2: Simplify transactions query to use only existing columns
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Only query existing columns and relationships
SELECT 
  ct.id,
  ct.transaction_type,
  ct.amount,
  ct.balance_before,              // ✅ Added
  ct.balance_after,
  ct.description,
  ct.stripe_payment_intent_id,    // ✅ This column exists
  ct.created_at,
  u.username as user_username
FROM credit_transactions ct
LEFT JOIN users u ON ct.user_id = u.id      // ✅ This FK exists
WHERE ct.customer_id = $1
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC
LIMIT $2 OFFSET $3
```

### Fix 3: Split INSERT and SELECT into separate queries
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Separate queries for better handling
// First, ensure customer_credits record exists
await query(
  `INSERT INTO customer_credits (customer_id, balance, total_purchased, total_used)
   VALUES ($1, 0, 0, 0)
   ON CONFLICT (customer_id) DO NOTHING`,
  [customerId]
);

// Then, fetch the balance
const result = await query(
  `SELECT balance, total_purchased, total_used, created_at, updated_at
   FROM customer_credits
   WHERE customer_id = $1`,
  [customerId]
);
```
