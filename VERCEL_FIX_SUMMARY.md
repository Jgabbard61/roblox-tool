# Vercel Deployment Fix - useSearchParams Suspense Boundary

## Issue
The Phase 2 deployment to Vercel was failing with the following error:
```
тип useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/dashboard"
```

This error occurs because Next.js requires `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in a Suspense boundary when used in Client Components, especially during pre-rendering.

## Solution
I've refactored the dashboard page to properly handle the `useSearchParams()` hook by:

1. **Created a separate component for search params handling**: 
   - `PaymentStatusHandler` component now handles the payment status query parameters
   - This component is wrapped in its own Suspense boundary

2. **Split the main component**:
   - `DashboardContent` contains all the main dashboard logic
   - Main `Dashboard` export wraps `DashboardContent` in a Suspense boundary with a loading fallback

3. **Proper error boundaries**:
   - Added loading states for both the search params handler and the main content
   - Ensures smooth user experience during SSR/SSG

## Changes Made
- **File Modified**: `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Commit**: "Fix: Wrap useSearchParams in Suspense boundary for dashboard page"
- **Pushed to**: `Jgabbard61/roblox-tool` main branch

## Technical Details
The fix follows Next.js best practices for handling search params:
- Search params are accessed in a separate client component
- Component is wrapped in `<Suspense>` boundary
- Fallback states are provided for loading scenarios
- No impact on existing functionality

## Verification
After this fix, Vercel should successfully:
1. Build the project without errors
2. Pre-render the dashboard page
3. Handle payment success/cancellation redirects properly

## Next Steps
1. Vercel will automatically redeploy when it detects the new commit
2. Monitor the Vercel deployment logs to confirm successful build
3. Test the dashboard page on the deployed URL
4. Verify payment flow redirects work as expected
